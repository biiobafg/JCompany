Unturned .Dat editor with a bunch of goodies in it, Will automatically add and remove comments for crafting + some other stuff (exact values for player damage, etc), copying and renaming icon files from Unturned/Extras/Icons (if they exist - they're easy to generate)

Contains a Preset menu so you can create your own for editing your server and not need to use Add Folder 50 times, can either use Workshop Ids and it'll load it from the workshop folder, or use just a regular file path such as Z:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Unturned\Bundles\Items - will be autogenerated as Presets.Json in your documents folder (it has a few folders from semi-popular servers in it)
Its not very organised but it works 

I dont really care if you use this or edit it in any way shape or form just give me an epic #Shoutout please and thanks.
